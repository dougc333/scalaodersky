my practice work for learning scala

1) practice recursion. The Man tries to stress recursion vs. for/while loops. This is ok but I don't see this in production code where the loop size or stack size is dependent on the data side. I know there is an argument for tail recursion optimization where there is 1 stack frame vs one stack frame per function call. I don't see a lot of examples of tail recursion replacing for/while loops in Spark code
2) matching and lists traversal. The Man wants us to use recursion for lists vs. for loops. I get it. Still not visible in production code.
