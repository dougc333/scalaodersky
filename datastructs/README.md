practice scala datastructs 
linkedlist is equivalent to the first scala course 2nd-3rd week where we do the function set and object oriented set. 
there aren't enough code samples in the lectures to practice. 

linkedlist taken from: https://github.com/mauricio/list-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/scala/list/LinkedList.scala
and: http://mauricio.github.io/2013/11/25/learning-scala-by-building-scala-lists.html

linkedlist  design:
1) apply() required for scala objects to apply functions to
2) foreach() required for map/flatmap to work via traversable



the test code only uses scalatest and not a higher level framework like specs2 or scalacheck
